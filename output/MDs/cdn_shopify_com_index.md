Features

Features

File compression.

File size is automatically optimized when you upload to

Shopify. The change in file quality isn’t noticeable to the

human eye, but it’ll improve page load time.

File format conversion.

Shopify automatically detects which file formats are supported

on the client side and sends the best option. Example:

Converts images to WebP or AVIF where supported, but JPG as a fallback

for other clients.

Dynamic editing.

Unlike destructive editing, dynamic editing allows you to crop

and transform your image without losing the original file.

Simply indicate the desired state using URL parameters. These

parameters will be interpreted and used to “on-the-fly”

transform the file. The original file remains preserved and

untouched.

All in real time.

The compression, file format conversion, and dynamic editing

all happen in real time. Users have negligible to no wait time

as our servers around the world ensure ultra fast delivery.
