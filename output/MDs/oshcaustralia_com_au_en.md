It's a visa requirement and ensures access to healthcare services, including medical treatment and hospital care, while you study in Australia, providing essential financial protection for unexpected health expenses.

Can I Switch My Overseas Student Health Cover Provider?

Yes, international students in Australia can typically switch their Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) provider. However, it's essential to ensure continuous coverage, compare policies, and consider waiting periods and benefits before making the switch to make an informed decision.

and we can help you make the transition if you’re looking to stay in Australia.

Who Else Can Be Covered With OSHC?

OSHC can cover dependents, such as a spouse or children, accompanying international students on a student visa in Australia. Coverage details may vary among providers.

How Long Do I Need OSHC?

You need OSHC for the total duration of your study in Australia, and for any extra time you may be spending in Australia once your studies have finished. If your OSHC lapses, then your visa will be cancelled.

What Does OSHC Cover?

Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) in Australia typically covers medical services such as:

Doctor's visits

Hospitalisation

Surgery

Prescription medications, and

Emergency ambulance services.

It may also include some allied health services like physiotherapy and optical services, depending on the chosen policy. Specific coverage can vary among providers.

When am I going to receive the policy certificate?

The insurance policy certificate will be sent by email as soon as your payment is received by Cohort Go. Insurance paid on the credit card is typically received after a few minutes.

If you are extending or changing the dates of your current policy, then it can take up to 24 - 48 business hours to receive the updated policy certificate.

Can I buy a single policy if I am a dependent on someone else's student visa?

If you have separate student visas, then you can purchase 2 single policies. However, if one of you is dependent on the other's student visa, it would be best to purchase a couple's policy.

The couple policy tends to be a lot more expensive than purchasing 2 single policies. Insurers have told us that the reason for this is that they typically have a lot of claims from couples when they come to Australia to study and become pregnant. The insurers, therefore, increase the premiums for couples and families policies to take this risk into account.

I am on a bridging visa, what insurance do I need?

If you are on a bridging visa and your most recent visa is a student visa, then OSHC is the right insurance for you as stated by Australian Government in

Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC) resources

.

If you don't know how long you need insurance for, simply purchase 1 year's insurance.  If your new visa comes through, then you can cancel your policy and get a refund for the remaining term of your OSHC policy.

If you are looking to get a 485 visa and need to prove that you have health insurance, then there is a special type of insurance that you need to get. Some OVHC policies cover this, but not all. We have some of these on our website:

Can I cancel my student health insurance?

You can only cancel your OSHC and get a refund in certain circumstances.

Instances where you are allowed to cancel your OSHC:

You did not take up studies in Australia

You have paid the premium on the basis of an extended stay but the extension of authorised stay was not granted by Australian Government Department of Immigration and Border Protection;

You are obliged to cease studies and leave Australia before the end of a period of approved stay for reasons beyond your control;

You have been granted permanent residence in Australia, or another Australian visa (other than a Student Visa);

You can prove to the insurer that you were not resident in Australia for a continuous period of 3 months or more;

You can provide proof of OSHC provided by another insurer which includes the period covered by your insurer.

You made a mistake by inputting your name incorrectly;

Your student visa has been refused;

You should speak directly to your insurer if you need to cancel your insurance for reasons outside of the above.

In case you have purchased an OSHC policy and your visa has been refused, you are eligible for a full refund of the premium you have paid.

Please send an email to

[email protected]

, along with your visa refusal letter, cancelled COE, or a visa withdrawal letter so we can process your cancellation for you with the insurance company.

How can I switch my OSHC insurance provider

If you are looking to switch your policy from the current insurer to another OSHC insurer, first you would need to purchase a policy with the new insurer and then cancel your current OSHC policy with your current insurer.

In terms of how much you would receive a refund from your current insurer, typically you should receive a pro-rata refund of your premium for the days you wish to switch to another provider.
