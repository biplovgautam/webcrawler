One great place for various products on cheaper price

I found baby products in cheaper price. App is great as well. It will be great if out of stock product be updated on app itself rather than informing through phone call.

Good App, Bad Communication and Service

The UX of the app is great, it's fairly easy to use and the concept of online consultation is much needed. HOWEVER the service and final delivery was very disappointing. I was called 2 days after the confirmation of my order that it may take 2-3 days until my order arrives as they are busy. I appreciated their notice and I waited and then was called again after 3 days and told I will not only need to wait ANOTHER 3-4 days, but that a few of the items I ordered has gone out of stock.

I was still patient and waited over a week for the medicine/goods to arrive only to find that over half of the items were not there. Furthermore the sale prices on the app somehow did not apply on the final bill that I paid.

Unproffesional and no update of delivery status

The delivery status is not updated in the system and they do not inform you if the product ordered is not available. So literally we customers are expected to follow up for each and every order. It was very easy and professional before covid but now they even take the delivery charges and the delivery is delayed...Disappointing
